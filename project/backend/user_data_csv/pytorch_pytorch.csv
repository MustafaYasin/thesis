alexbw,Alex Wiltschko,,alex.bw@gmail.com,"['Sampling Inference for Bayesian HSMMs and HMMs \n This is a Python library for approximate unsupervised sampling inference in\nBayesian Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and explicit-duration Hidden semi-Markov\nModels (HSMMs), focusing on the Bayesian Nonparametric extensions, the HDP-HMM\nand HDP-HSMM, via the weak-limit approximation. \n There are also some plugins to extend the functionality: \n \n factorial models \n autoregressive models \n collapsed HDP sampling inference . \n \n The inference can be run in parallel over multiple cores and/or multiple\nmachines (even on EC2!) using  ipython \'s\nexcellent  ipython.parallel  module. Someday I might even document how to do\nit! \n Installing \n You can clone this library and its dependencies with \n git clone --recursive git://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm.git \n The library depends on  numpy ,  scipy , and, for visualization,  matplotlib . \n Disabling assertions may speed things up; to disable assertions, run your\nCPython interpreter with the  -O  flag. \n A Simple Demonstration \n Here\'s how to draw from the HDP-HSMM posterior over HSMMs given a sequence of\nobservations. (The same example, along with the code to generate the synthetic\ndata loaded in this example, can be found in  examples/basic.py .) \n Let\'s say we have some 2D data in a data.txt file: \n bash\n head -5 data.txt\n-3.711962552600095444e-02 1.456401745267922598e-01\n7.553818775915704942e-02 2.457422192223903679e-01\n-2.465977987699214502e+00 5.537627981813508793e-01\n-7.031638516485749779e-01 1.536468304146855757e-01\n-9.224669847039665971e-01 3.680035337673161489e-01 \n In Python, we can plot the data in a 2D plot, collapsing out the time dimension: \n ```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt \n data = np.loadtxt(\'data.txt\')\nplt.plot(data[:,0],data[:,1],\'kx\')\n``` \n \n We can also make a plot of time versus the first principal component: \n python\nfrom pyhsmm.util.plot import pca_project_data\nplt.plot(pca_project_data(data,1)) \n \n To learn an HSMM, we\'ll use  pyhsmm  to create an  HSMM  instance using some\nreasonable hyperparameters. We\'ll ask this model to infer the number of states\nas well (since an HDP-HSMM is instantiated by default), so we\'ll give it an\n Nmax  parameter: \n ```python\nimport pyhsmm\nimport pyhsmm.basic.distributions as distributions \n obs_dim = 2\nNmax = 25 \n obs_hypparams = {\'mu_0\':np.zeros(obs_dim),\n                \'sigma_0\':np.eye(obs_dim),\n                \'kappa_0\':0.3,\n                \'nu_0\':obs_dim+5}\ndur_hypparams = {\'alpha_0\':2*30,\n                 \'beta_0\':2} \n obs_distns = [distributions.Gaussian( obs_hypparams) for state in range(Nmax)]\ndur_distns = [distributions.PoissonDuration( dur_hypparams) for state in range(Nmax)] \n posteriormodel = pyhsmm.models.HSMM(\n        alpha=6.,gamma=6., # better to sample over these; see concentration-resampling.py\n        init_state_concentration=6., # pretty inconsequential\n        obs_distns=obs_distns,\n        dur_distns=dur_distns,\n        trunc=60) # duration truncation speeds things up when it\'s possible\n``` \n (The first two arguments set the ""new-table"" proportionality constant for the\nmeta-Chinese Restaurant Process and the other CRPs, respectively, in the HDP\nprior on transition matrices. For this example, they really don\'t matter at\nall, but on real data it\'s much better to infer these parameters, as in\n examples/concentration_resampling.py .) \n The  trunc  parameter is an optional argument that can speed up inference: it\nsets a truncation limit on the maximum duration for any state. If you don\'t\npass in the  trunc  argument, no truncation is used and all possible state\nduration lengths are considered. \n Then, we add the data we want to condition on: \n python\nposteriormodel.add_data(data) \n (If we had multiple observation sequences to learn from, we could add them to the\nmodel just by calling  add_data()  for each observation sequence.) \n Now we run a resampling loop. For each iteration of the loop, all the latent\nvariables of the model will be resampled by Gibbs sampling steps, including the\ntransition matrix, the observation means and covariances, the duration\nparameters, and the hidden state sequence. We\'ll also copy some samples so that\nwe can plot them. \n python\nmodels = []\nfor idx in progprint_xrange(150):\n    posteriormodel.resample_model()\n    if (idx+1) % 10 == 0:\n        models.append(copy.deepcopy(posteriormodel)) \n Now we can plot our saved samples: \n python\nfig = plt.figure()\nfor idx, model in enumerate(models):\n    plt.clf()\n    model.plot()\n    plt.gcf().suptitle(\'HDP-HSMM sampled after %d iterations\' % (10*(idx+1)))\n    plt.savefig(\'iter_%.3d.png\' % (10*(idx+1))) \n \n I generated these data from an HSMM that looked like this: \n \n So the posterior samples look pretty good! \n Speed \n HSMMs constitute a much more powerful model class than plain-old HMMs, and that\nenhanced power comes with a computational price: each sampling iteration for an\nHSMM is much slower than that of an HMM. But that price is often worthwhile if\nyou want to place priors on state durations or have the model learn duration\nstructure present in the data. (In the example, strong duration structure is\nwhat made the inference algorithm latch onto the correct explanation so\neasily.) In addition, the increased cost of each iteration often pays for\nitself, since HSMM samplers empirically seem to take fewer iterations to\nconverge than comparable HMM samplers. \n Using my nothing-special i7-920 desktop machine and a NumPy/SciPy built against\nIntel\'s MKL BLAS (which generally outperforms ATLAS for vectorized operations)\nalong with the Eigen-backed classes, here\'s how long the demo iterations took: \n $ python examples/hsmm.py\n.........................  [  25/100,    0.05sec avg,    3.95sec ETA ]\n.........................  [  50/100,    0.05sec avg,    2.64sec ETA ]\n.........................  [  75/100,    0.05sec avg,    1.34sec ETA ]\n.........................  [ 100/100,    0.05sec avg,    0.05sec ETA ]\n   0.05sec avg,    5.21sec total \n Extending the Code \n To add your own observation or duration distributions, implement the interfaces\ndefined in  basic/abstractions.py .

Change all the files that use RingBuffer from MyClass.m to MyClass.mm. \n Want some examples? \n Inside of ViewController.mm are a bunch of tiny little examples I wrote.

Chris Adamson and Michael Tyson are two giants in the field of iOS audio, and they each wrote indispensable blog posts ( this is Chris\'s ,  this is Michael\'s ). Also, Chris Adamson now has a  whole gosh-darned BOOK on Core Audio . I would have done unspeakable things to get my hands on this when I was first starting. \n', 'My Code for the Netflix Prize \n I\'m not aware of folks having published their code for the Netflix Prize. Here\'s mine. \nUnder the team name ""Hi!"", I competed alone in college. I did it mostly for fun, and to learn modern machine learning techniques. It was an incredibly valuable, but strenuous, time. Well worth it on all fronts, though.  \nI peaked out at #45 or so, and then dropped out to work on my senior thesis, and came in #145 or so.   \nWhat I learned in the process was that smarter wasn\'t always better -- make an algorithm, and then scale it up, and then make a dozen tweaks to it, and then average all of the results together. That\'s how you climbed the leaderboard.    \n Anyhoo, I haven\'t touched this code in awhile, but perhaps it\'ll be useful to folks interested in competitive data mining. \nSpecifically, the lessons I learned: \n \n Get the raw data into a saved and manageable format  fast . The easier it is to load your data in and start mutating it, the better. \n If doing simple pivots on your data is hard, and slows you down from visualizing whats in your data, spend time making data structures which make that easy.   \n Generalize. Iterate. If you have a method you think will work, but it has a lot of knobs, and you don\'t know the best way to set those knobs, make it easy for you to try  every possible iteration . There is often not a good way to figure out what the  best  approach is. You will have to try many of them in order to build up an intuition. Specifically, that means (for me) a pluggable architecture. If there\'s ten ways to try a particular step, make sure you write your overarching algorithm so that it takes a function that you can pass to it, as opposed to having a method hardwired in the code. That way, you can hotswap all your ideas.   \n Speed is a feature. Of course you make sure it works first. But your goal is to see if something works. If an algorithm takes a day to run, but you can spend five hours making it run in 1/3 of a day, do it. You\'ll be running it over and over again, and you\'ll learn more if you can iterate.  \n \n As for the technical nitty-gritty, everything that\'s speed sensitive is written in Cython, which was the best balance of speed and convenience in 2009. If I were to do it al again, I would use (Numba)[http://github.com/numba/numba].   \n The original data is gone, I believe, but I might have it stored somewhere. I\'ll look for that.

Specifically, this code implements the automated extraction of scanned AMPS tubes from flatbed scanner images, the distillation of those images into 1D data traces, and then the automated identification of the anemic disease state of the blood in those 1D data traces, as well as the prediction of continuously-varying red blood cell (RBC) parameters. \n Installation \n This code requires Python, as well as some extra 3rd-party libraries. All routines have only been tested on Mac OS, but should work on Linux. No guarantees for Windows.\n1) First, we recommend using the ""Anaconda"" Python distribution, specifically the Python 2.7 version.

Inside this code repository, start up an IPython notebook:\n jupyter notebook \n1) You should now be able to browser around the ""extraction"" and ""analysis"" folders, which contain the relevant code. \n Running extraction \n The first step required will be to prepare the raw data of TIFF file scans of 4x3=12 tubes from a flatbed scanner. We will also have to associate metadata for each patient that the blood in a tube was drawn from.\nOur end goal will be a 1D array for each tube, along with the corresponding patient data (anemic state & RBC parameters). \n The extraction algorithm is explained step-by-step in the notebook  extraction/Explaining the Extraction Algorithm.ipynb .\nThe implementation we use in the paper (which also fuses patient metadata with AMPS image data) can be found in  extraction/Data Extraction Pipeline.ipynb . Most of the code in this notebook is specific to the particular Excel file format that we used to record patient metadata, and may have to be largely rewritten for reuse. \n Running analysis \n There are two sets of analyses done in the paper: classification and regression. \n Running classification analysis \n The goal of this analysis is to predict disease state only from the 1D data trace extracted from each AMPS tube. We use logistic regression, a linear classifier, and transform the 1D data representation using PCA to remove redundancy and constrain the input dimensionality of the problem. We also used Bayesian Optimization (bayesopt) to tune the hyperparameters of the problem, including the specific output dimension of PCA, the regularization parameter of logistic regression, and some image preprocessing parameters. Unfortunately, the service we used for bayesopt is no longer available. If you would like to automatically tune these parameters, we recommend either using random search (a surprisingly effective hueristic), or the open source library ""Spearmint"", upon which the now-defunct service we used was based, or products from the company SigOpt, which also implements bayesopt. The file we used to automatically tune these hypers is  classify.py .\nThe best set of hyperparameters is stored in the notebook  Analyzing best classification.ipynb .\nThis notebook examines ROC performance of the classifier for discriminating different anemia types, as well as the effect of centrifugation time of the tube on IDA classification AUC performance. \n Running regression analysis. \n Similar to above, we used a defunct bayesopt service to automatically tune some parameters of this algorithm. The original file is in  regress.py . The original methodology will work well, even without automated tuning.\nThe best set of hyperparameters is stored in the notebook  Analyzing best regression.ipynb . \n License \n See the LICENSE file.
